**Project Overview**
This project portfolio is a dynamic website that aims to showcase an intuitive frontend design and logical functionality. 

The site is divided into 5 parts: 

1. Home, where an introduction can be found; 
2. About, which contains basic information about the creator; 
3. Skills, where the creator’s abilities are presented; 
4. Works, which showcases evidence of completed and collaborative projects; 
4. and lastly, Contact, where clients can reach out through a project inquiry form and appointment booking transaction.

In terms of its design, there’s a hint of glassmorphism that can be easily seen at first glance. What makes it more effective is the integration of EmailJS for managing client inquiries and bookings, Geoapify for geographic viewing, and Google Calendar for looking at live scheduling.

To conclude, this is not just a static website. It is designed to showcase API integration, logic, functionality, and UI/UX principles.

**Transaction Features:**
1. Inquiry Form
- This feature lets the clients and visitors send a message, question, or discussion of a potential project.
2. Appointment Booking
- This feature allows the users to book their appointment through filling out a form. A live calendar is also displayed for them to view available dates. In this transaction, once users have booked their desired date, the booking details are sent to the developer’s inbox, and the developer will manually add the appointment to her calendar.

**APIs Integrated:**
1. EmailJS
- Purpose: Communication
- It handles both the project inquiry form and appointment booking transaction. Once the user fills out the form and sends a message or book an appointment, it goes straight to the developer’s email inbox.

2. Google Calendar
- Purpose: Scheduling
- It helps display the developer’s availability. It lets the clients know if there are still available date slots.

3. Geoapify
- Purpose: Location 
- This allows the clients to see the developer’s location.

**Instructions on how to use it:**
1. Download the folder.
2. Launch your Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and open the folder.
3. Once opened, ensure that the “Live Server” extension is installed.
4. Click the “Go Live” at the bottom right part to launch.
